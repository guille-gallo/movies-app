    Writing unit tests for Material-UI components using Jest can be particularly challenging,
    due to the complex DOM structure and difficulty in reliably targeting elements. 
    To address this and ensure robust test coverage, I opted for Cypress to perform end-to-end tests, 
    as it allows for more seamless interaction with Material-UI components and better reflects real user behavior.

-Additional issues solved on app first start up:
1- Since the provided app works with Node v14, I had this issue when trying to start it from macOS:
    SOLUTION:
        Install Rosetta by running in the macOS Terminal:
        softwareupdate --install-rosetta
        arch -x86_64 zsh
        nvm install lts/dubnium

2- Missing /public directory with index.html:
    SOLUTION:
        Added /public/index.html

3- Wrong id provided in index.html:
    SOLUTION:
        Change <div id="app"></div> to <div id="root"></div>
        Because of render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'))
